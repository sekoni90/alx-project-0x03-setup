Overview
This project is a Next.js application called “Splash App” that demonstrates modern web development practices including shared layouts, component-based architecture, routing, and responsive design. The application serves as a foundation for building AI-powered features with a clean, professional UI.

# Learning Objectives
Implement shared layouts using the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle
Configure and use Google Fonts with Tailwind CSS
Implement imperative routing with Next.js
Organize code with proper interface management
Create custom error pages for better user experience
Structure React components for reusability
Work with TypeScript for type safety
# Key Concepts
Layout Components: Creating reusable Header, Footer, and Layout components
Component Architecture: Building modular, reusable components (like Button)
Routing: Implementing both declarative and imperative navigation
Styling: Using Tailwind CSS with custom configurations
TypeScript: Implementing interfaces for type safety
Error Handling: Creating custom 404 pages
Responsive Design: Ensuring the application works on all device sizes
# Tools and Libraries
Next.js: React framework with built-in routing and SSR capabilities
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework
TypeScript: Typed superset of JavaScript
React Icons: Icon library for React
Google Fonts: Web font service
# Real World Use Case
This setup mimics real-world application development where: - Multiple pages share common layout elements - Applications need consistent branding and navigation - Teams need organized code structure for maintainability - Users expect responsive design across devices - Applications need proper error handling for better UX

The foundation can be extended to build various AI features like: - Text generation tools - Text-to-image conversion applications - Interactive AI interfaces

This project structure is scalable and follows industry best practices, making it suitable for production applications.
